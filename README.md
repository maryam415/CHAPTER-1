in this code value is depended on instance of classes if the vale is change then the instance will be change.
class variable is shared among all objects, while instance variables are unique to each object.
It also shows inheritance and dynamic attribute creation, where a subclass inherits methods from its parent class.
**DIR.PY**
first checks if a number is positive, zero, or negative — since num = 1, it prints “Positive number.”
Then it calculates the total of the list [6, 6, 3, 8, -3, 2, 5, 44, 12], which adds up to 83, and prints “The sum is 83.
**DO_SOMETHING.PY**
In this code only handles the other files of the code.
**FILE.PY**
In this code file is created and write some lines in this file.
**FLOW.PY**
This program first checks if a number is positive, zero, or negative (prints “Positive number”).
Then it calculates the sum of a list of numbers (83) using a for loop, and finally, it adds numbers from 1 to 10 (55) using a while loop.
**MULTIPROCESSING.PY**
creates 10 parallel processes using Python’s multiprocessing module, where each process sums numbers up to 10 million.
After all processes finish, it prints “List processing complete” and the total execution time, showing how multiprocessing speeds up heavy computations.
**MULTITHREADING.PY**
This program tries to perform the same heavy calculation using multithreading, but because the function is called directly instead of being passed as a target, the computation runs sequentially.
It still prints “List processing complete” and the total time taken, showing how threads are intended to manage parallel tasks.
